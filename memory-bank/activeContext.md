# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Implementing punishing survival mechanics based on new game concept:
1. **ðŸ”„ Punishing Mechanics Implementation**: Converting to survival-focused gameplay
2. **ðŸ”„ Mental Health System**: New deterioration mechanic tied to inflation
3. **ðŸ”„ Market Algorithm Overhaul**: Removing bull markets, implementing permanent decline
4. **ðŸ”„ Power-up Cooldown System**: Adding 5-10 second random cooldowns
5. **ðŸ”„ Black Swan Amplification**: Making events extremely punishing

## Recent Completed Work

### Layout System Implementation (COMPLETED)
- **âœ… LayoutUtils Class**: Created responsive positioning utility
- **âœ… Percentage-based Positioning**: Replaced hardcoded pixel coordinates
- **âœ… Responsive Font Sizing**: Dynamic font sizes based on screen dimensions
- **âœ… Consistent Color Scheme**: Unified color system (green/red/white)
- **âœ… Visual Hierarchy**: Clear primary/secondary information display

### UI Issues Resolved
- **âœ… Text Positioning**: All UI elements now use responsive positioning
- **âœ… Layout Consistency**: Unified spacing and alignment system implemented
- **âœ… Responsive Design**: Positions adapt to different screen sizes (320x320 to 1024x1024)
- **âœ… Visual Hierarchy**: Information properly prioritized with font sizes and colors

### Error Handling Deficiencies
- **Trade Validation**: Limited checks for insufficient funds/assets
- **Audio Fallback**: Basic try-catch for ambience, needs expansion
- **Input Validation**: No validation for edge cases in trading
- **User Feedback**: Errors only logged to console, not shown to user

### Game Balance Issues
- **Economic Parameters**: Inflation calculation needs refinement
- **Event Timing**: Random timers may create poor pacing
- **Power-up Balance**: Some modifiers may be overpowered
- **Difficulty Curve**: No progressive challenge system

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### UI Architecture Approach
- **Container-based Layout**: Use Phaser containers for grouped elements
- **Responsive Positioning**: Percentage-based positioning system
- **Style Consistency**: Unified color scheme and typography
- **Information Hierarchy**: Clear primary/secondary information display

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Centralized System**: Create error handling utility class
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Replace console logs with UI feedback
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallbacks for failed operations
- **Validation Layer**: Pre-execution checks for all user actions

### Development Priorities
1. **Immediate**: Fix critical UI positioning issues
2. **Short-term**: Implement comprehensive error handling
3. **Medium-term**: Balance economic parameters
4. **Long-term**: Add advanced features (achievements, multiplayer)

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: UI Improvements (2-3 days)
- Create responsive layout system
- Implement container-based UI organization
- Establish consistent styling patterns
- Test across different screen sizes

### Phase 2: Error Handling (2-3 days)
- Build centralized error management system
- Add input validation for all user actions
- Implement user-friendly error messages
- Create fallback mechanisms for critical failures

### Phase 3: Game Balance (3-5 days)
- Analyze and tune economic parameters
- Implement progressive difficulty scaling
- Balance power-up and black swan effects
- Add achievement system for engagement

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Code Style**: ES6+ syntax with clear variable naming
- **Architecture**: Scene-based with event-driven communication
- **UI Philosophy**: Minimalist design with clear feedback
- **Performance**: 60fps target with efficient asset management

## Learnings and Project Insights
- **Phaser Strengths**: Excellent for 2D games with built-in physics
- **Event System**: EventsCenter pattern works well for decoupled communication
- **Asset Management**: Current system handles loading well but needs optimization
- **Game Loop**: Update cycle efficiently handles multiple timers and calculations
