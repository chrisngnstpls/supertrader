# Progress Tracking

## What Works (Completed Features)

### Core Game Mechanics
- ✅ **Trading System**: Long/short position management with entry/exit tracking
- ✅ **Price Generation**: Three-phase algorithm (bounds → seasons → random generation)
- ✅ **Market Seasons**: Bull/bear/crab market dynamics affecting price movement
- ✅ **Inflation System**: Gradual erosion of cash value over time
- ✅ **Game Over Logic**: Triggers when both money and assets fall below threshold

### Event System
- ✅ **Power-ups**: 6 different positive events with modifiers
- ✅ **Black Swans**: Negative events system (structure in place)
- ✅ **Event Timing**: Random timer-based event triggering
- ✅ **Event Communication**: EventsCenter mediating scene interactions

### Audio/Visual
- ✅ **Asset Loading**: Complete preloader for images, audio, tilemaps
- ✅ **Animations**: Character sprites with up/down/side animations
- ✅ **Sound Effects**: Comprehensive audio feedback for all actions
- ✅ **Background Music**: Looping tracks for different game states

### Scene Management
- ✅ **Scene Flow**: Preloader → Title → Game → Events → GameOver
- ✅ **Data Passing**: User state and game data between scenes
- ✅ **Modal Windows**: Draggable event windows over main game

## What's Left to Build

### UI/UX Improvements
- ✅ **Responsive Layout**: Container-based positioning system implemented
- ✅ **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear information prioritization with font sizing
- ✅ **Style Consistency**: Unified color scheme and typography implemented
- ✅ **Responsive Positioning**: All UI elements use percentage-based positioning
- 🔄 **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly interface elements (future enhancement)

### Error Handling
- 🔄 **Input Validation**: Pre-execution checks for all user actions
- 🔄 **User Feedback**: Replace console logs with UI error messages
- 🔄 **Graceful Degradation**: Fallbacks for failed operations
- 🔄 **Centralized System**: Error handling utility class

### Game Balance (HIGH PRIORITY - PUNISHING MECHANICS)
- 🔄 **Mental Health System**: New deterioration mechanic tied to inflation
- 🔄 **Market Algorithm**: Remove bull markets, implement permanent decline
- 🔄 **Power-up Cooldown**: 5-10 second random cooldowns between power-ups
- 🔄 **Black Swan Amplification**: 3-5x impact increase for extreme punishment
- 🔄 **Survival Scoring**: Replace profit-based scoring with survival time
- 🔄 **Difficulty Acceleration**: Escalating challenge that becomes impossible

### Advanced Features
- ⏳ **Achievement System**: Progress tracking and rewards
- ⏳ **Local Storage**: Save game state and high scores
- ⏳ **Statistics**: Detailed performance analytics
- ⏳ **Tutorial System**: Guided first-time experience

## Current Status

### Recently Completed

- Game balance parameter review

### Next Milestones
1. **UI Overhaul** (Week 1): Responsive layout implementation
2. **Error System** (Week 2): Comprehensive validation and feedback
3. **Balance Pass** (Week 3): Economic parameter tuning
4. **Polish Phase** (Week 4): Performance optimization and testing

## Known Issues

### Critical
1. **UI Overlap**: Text elements may overlap at certain resolutions
2. **Trade Validation**: Insufficient funds/assets not properly validated
3. **Audio Fallback**: Limited error handling for audio loading failures

### Medium Priority
1. **Inflation Calculation**: Inconsistent application in some scenarios
2. **Event Timing**: Potential for simultaneous power-up/black swan events
3. **Memory Management**: No sprite pooling for event windows

### Low Priority
1. **Code Organization**: Some functions could be better modularized
2. **Performance**: Minor optimizations possible in update loop
3. **Asset Optimization**: Images could be compressed further

## Optimization Opportunities

### Performance
- **Sprite Pooling**: Reuse event window objects
- **Audio Management**: Preload and cache audio more efficiently
- **Update Loop**: Optimize timer calculations

### Code Quality
- **Modularization**: Extract utility functions
- **Type Safety**: Consider TypeScript migration
- **Documentation**: Add JSDoc comments

### User Experience
- **Loading States**: Better feedback during asset loading
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation support
- **Internationalization**: Multi-language support preparation

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial**: Simple trading game concept
- **Current**: Complex economic simulation with events
- **Future**: Potential multiplayer and advanced analytics
- **Architecture**: Evolved from simple to event-driven system
- **Scope**: Expanded from basic trading to full market simulation
