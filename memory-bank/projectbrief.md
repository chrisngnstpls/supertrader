# SuperTrader Project Brief

## Core Concept
A punishing Phaser-based survival trading game where players:
- Fight for survival in a dying market that only goes down
- Experience temporary power-ups and devastating black swan events
- Witness the market's final collapse while trying to stay alive as long as possible
- **You cannot win this game, you can only survive**

## Key Features
- Permanent downward market trend with liquidity traps
- Mental health system tied to inflation deterioration
- Extremely punishing black swan events
- Temporary power-ups with cooldown periods
- Survival time as primary scoring mechanism
- Accelerating difficulty that becomes impossible

## Goals
1. Create a punishing survival experience
2. Implement unforgiving economic mechanics
3. Build tension through inevitable decline
4. Ensure the game is consistently hard
5. Make survival time the ultimate achievement

## Scope
- Single-player survival experience
- Browser-based deployment
- Punishing difficulty from start to finish
- Survival time leaderboards

## Success Metrics
- Average survival time (target: 3-7 minutes before inevitable failure)
- Player retry rate (addiction to "just one more try")
- Mental health depletion rate
- Black swan impact effectiveness
